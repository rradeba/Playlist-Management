Mini-Project: Playlist Management API
Problem Statement:
Our goal is to develop a playlist management system that lets you create songs, create a playlist, and add songs and remove songs from that playlist(s).

Project Requirements
Data Organization with Lists and Dictionaries:
Implement operations for managing playlists & songs.
Provide functionalities to add songs and create playlists
Ensure effective storage and retrieval of playlist information. We learned about a lot of algorithms to help efficiently manage these things. What might be useful to implement this? 
Efficient Search and Sort Algorithms for Playlist Navigation:
Implement a search and sort algorithm for finding a song or sorting songs based off name, artist, or genre.
Analyze the time complexity and performance trade-offs of search and sort algorithms in playlist management.
Building a Flask API for Playlist Access and Management:
Implement CRUD endpoints using Flask for managing playlists and songs.
API endpoints:
Song Endpoints:
Create Song
Update Song
Delete Song
Search/Get a Song
Playlist Endpoints:
Create Playlist
Get Playlist
Update Playlist
Delete Playlist:
Additional Endpoints:
Add song to Playlist
Remove song from Playlist
Sort songs in Playlist by song name, genre, and artist
Additional Notes: As stated before, you've learned about a lot of new algorithms and ways to handle data. How might some of those things you learned be of use here? How might stacks or queues for removing songs from the beginning or end of a playlist be useful. How might something like a linked list come in handy? What kind of efficient search or sort algorithms might help handle a playlist thousands long?
NOTE: Ensure that all code in your file is ready to run. This means that if someone opens your file and clicks the run button at the top, all code executes as intended. For example, if there are if statements, print statements, or for loops, they should function correctly and display output in the console as expected. If you have a function, make sure the function is called and runs. If there are classes/objects, make sure they are instantiated and the methods are called.

The goal of this note is to ensure that all code in your Python file runs smoothly and that is has been tested.
